# Project-Personal-Reading-Journal-and-Quote-Collector

My Name is Kiran Hamza

ðŸ’¡ #Project Description
This is a command-line application built using Python that allows users to manage and organize their personal reading records and favorite literary quotes. The purpose of the project is to help readers keep track of the books theyâ€™ve read, their reading status, and quotes that stood out to them during reading.

The application supports key features such as:

Adding and viewing books with details like title, author, year, genre(s), and reading status.

Searching and filtering books by genre or reading status.

Updating or deleting book records.

Collecting quotes with the ability to sort, search, and manage them.

Providing analytical insights such as identifying the year with the most completed books, the book with the most quotes, and the author with the most entries.

All data is saved persistently using file handling, and the program ensures case-insensitive string comparison for better usability. It includes input validation, modular design using functions, and efficient data handling using dictionaries, lists, and sets.

âœ… Key Concepts Used
Python basics: strings, lists, dictionaries, sets

Control flow: loops, if-else statements

Functions: at least three user-defined for modularity

File handling for data persistence

String operations and input validation

Sorting and searching logic
